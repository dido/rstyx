## 0.4.2

This is a bugfix release. Unit testing uncovered many serious bugs
in the server code.

## 0.4.1

Clarified licensing issues to LGPLv3 and Ruby License.  Set up some
basic support for server-side Inferno authentication, and do some form
of correct permission checks on file requests.  There's bound to be
lots of security bugs in this release, but we'll find them and fix
them someday...

## 0.4.0

Added some basic support for the Inferno authentication protocol.  At
the moment, only the Styx client supports Inferno authentication.
